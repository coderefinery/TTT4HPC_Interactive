# Motivation

This day is about the daily struggle with HPC: how do people
actually interact with the cluster?  What are the nicer tools than
SSH, but can' be taught in normal courses since they don't work for
everywhere/everyone?


You will see these ways of interaction today:

- Transferring data
- Transferring code
- Running in testing or interactive mode on the cluster.
- Using graphical interfaces on the cluster.
- Using an IDE (VS Code)


We will try to explain the *geography* of the cluster: what is
everything?  How does it connect?  How do you move from place to place?
Which places are the same?  And so on.  For example,

- Different directories in different places (or the same ones, mounted)
- Different speed of access to data from different places.



## About the homework

This day has various exercises/homeworks embedded within it.  Unlike
day 1, these aren't as exciting since they are mostly repeating what
is demoed.  We can adjust the exercises to suit people's interests.
