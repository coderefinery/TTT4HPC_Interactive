# Motivation

This day is about the daily struggle with HPC: how do people
actually interact with the cluster?  What are the nicer tools than
SSH, but can' be taught in normal courses since they don't work for
everywhere/everyone?


You will see these ways of interaction today:

- Transferring data
- Transferring code
- Running in testing or interactive mode on the cluster.
- Using graphical interfaces on the cluster.
- Using an IDE (VS Code)


We will try to explain the *geography* of the cluster: what is
everything?  How does it connect?  How do you move from place to place?
Which places are the same?  And so on.  For example,

- Different directories in different places (or the same ones, mounted)
- Different speed of access to data from different places.



## About the homework

This day has various exercises/homeworks embedded within it.  Unlike
day 1, these are mostly doing implementing the demos and trying them
out.  We can adjust the exercises to suit people's interests.

Many of them require something to be installed on your own computer,
since they are about copying data to or from the cluster, and you need
the corresponding program installed.  This may make some of the
exercises harder to do for some people.  We'll discuss that in the
exercise session.
