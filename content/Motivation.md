# Motivation

- start broad, what to do when getting access to a cluster -> "a day in the life with HPC"
- story: maybe run a simple script that makes a figure ?
- geography of things: different homes in different places, different speed of access to data)
- Next: we show how to do it with various options (terminal, screen, sinteractive, srun tty, sshfs, gui tools ood vscode)
