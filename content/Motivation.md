# Motivation

- This day is about the daily struggle with HPC: how do people
  actually interact with the cluster?  What are the nicer tools than
  SSH, but can' be taught in normal courses since they don't work for
  everywhere/everyone?
- You will see these ways of interaction today:
  - Transferring data
  - Transferring code
  - Running in testing or interactive mode on the cluster.
  - Using graphical interfaces on the cluster.
  - Using an IDE (VS Code)
- We will try to explain the *geography* of the cluster: what is
  everything?  How does it connect?
  - different homes in different places
  - different speed of access to data
